                    <p>As you probably know my name is Boyan. I'm currently in my senior year for my bachelor's in computer science
                        and this is my website for, well, everything! You can expect to find info about any projects I'm working on, 
                        both techincal and creative, as well as occasional blog posts about any adventures I go on.
                    </p>

                    <p>In 2023 I took a gap year from university in order to work without studies, rest, and travel. The first half
                        of the year was spend doing loads of the first two. Then I took four months to visit my family in Europe — 
                        two months with my Grandma in France, and two with the rest of my family in Bulgaria where I stayed with my 
                        Uncle. I hadn't been back since I was a baby — and that's where this website was originally born. It was the 
                        perfect project to engage me CS as well as creating a place to document my experiences. Sadly I lost most of 
                        the picutres and videos from that trip which is why you will only find a handful of articles from that time.
                    </p>

                    <p>I had never done any frontend work before, so the codebase for that website was a mess! If I couldn't figure 
                        something out I would just tweak it until it was OK and leave it alone. Overall it looked pretty good, but 
                        it wasn't very responsive or accessible, and there were defintely things I wanted to change about it. This led
                        to the redesign you see now, as the final project for my web development class. You can actually go view the 
                        old codebase on the github repo for this project, and if looking at horror-code is your thing, the old site is 
                        under the branch V1. 
                    </p>

                    <p>I'm excited about what this project is turning into, and I'm excited to start posting again! Thank you all for 
                        joining me here and taking the time to check everything out. Cheers. :)
