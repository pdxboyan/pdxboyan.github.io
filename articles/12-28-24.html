                    <p>December 23rd, Monday. I blinked my eyes open at 4am and rolled out of bed. After packing the last of my things I hopped in the car
                        and drove to Vancouver to meet up with my friend Ryan — we had an early flight to catch. After leaving his car in 
                        the overflow lot and going through a not too busy security line, we grabbed a quick breakfast near the gate. There was a boarding 
                        delay of a few hours due to the flight computer not calibrating all of the parameters correctly, but after a couple hours we were 
                        in the air with a nice view of downtown Portland. We were sat in the very back row next to the bathrooms, and one of the (very nice) 
                        flight attendents offered us free drinks! Everyone in our row chose Crater Lake Hazelnut Esspresso Vodka (not sponsered) over ice, 
                        and she even gave us Irish Cream to go along with it! Our flight was direct from PDX —> KOA and took about 6 and a half hours.    
                    </p>

                    <p>Once we landed, Ryan's dad picked us up and we headed straight to the resort to get settled in. After refreshing a little and having a 
                        bite to eat, we headed over to the pool and swam around for bit. We then got ready for a dinner reservation at a sushi bar nearby called 
                        Sansei's. Everything here was great, just a bit pricey. I ordered a tropical mai tai, and the fish was amazing, specifically the hamachi 
                        (yellowtail) and bluefin tuna. This was my first time in Hawaii, and nothing here looked real to me — the tall palm trees, the goats and 
                        birds roaming around, the color of the water! We stayed on the big island (Hawaiʻi) for our trip, but I will defintely have to come back 
                        to explore the others some day. Next time I'll cross surfing off of my bucket list for sure. I've never been anywhere tropical either — 
                        all of my previous travels were on very similar latitude lines so the climate was relatively similar everywhere I went.
