                    <p>At 7:30pm, on March 13th, I was sat in an airplane seat in the middle of the economy section with a whole 
                        row to myself waiting for the airline crew to finish their final checks before takeoff. I had a nine and 
                        a half hour flight ahead of me to London, where I had a two hour layover before my final destination — 
                        Marseille France. Knowing myself to be awful at falling asleep in cars, let alone airplanes, I had given 
                        myself plenty of things to entertain myself. I spent most of the flight listening to music and watching 
                        The Last Of Us. And if you're wondering, no, I wasn't able to sleep at all during that flight. Below is the 
                        last picture of me in Oregon before I left for Europe. There won't be any others until mid July so stay tuned 
                        for that.  
                    </p>

                    <p>After navigating through the airport in London, making my way through security, and finding some warm food, I sat 
                        exhausted at my gate. The flight to Marseille was uneventful; I actually slept on this one. All in all I was just 
                        happy to have found a flight all the way to France from Portland with just one short layover. My exact path was: 
                        PDX -> LHR -> MRS
                    </p>

                    <p>Once I found my Grandma we were on the road; roughly an hour drive to my new home, in the small town of 
                        Saint-Saturnin-lès-Avignon; population 5000. More specifically lying in the Southeastern part of France in the region 
                        Provence, near the city of Avignon. Known for its sunny landscapes, lavender fields, a plethora of wines, and markets 
                        sprawled throughout the different villages, the region of Provence has long attracted many important figures and 
                        gifted artists alike. Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, and Claude Monet are just a few examples of painters inspired 
                        by this region. The strong wind that blows through the entire region, known as the Mistral, is said to be the cause of 
                        the unique climate and "painter's light"; bringing constant dry air and breaking up any clouds that might form. 
                        Especially coming from the grey and rainy Portland Oregon, it was shocking just how few clouds I saw in my time here. 
                        But that was after I adjusted to the time difference.
                    </p>

                    <p>Jet lag is a brand new experience for me so the first couple days were spent doing nothing much other than unpacking and 
                        sleeping at strange hours. Once more or less adjusted, on the third day my Grandma invited me on a walk with a group she 
                        meets with every week in different parts of the countryside. At 8am sharp on Thursday morning we met in a community parking 
                        lot in the center of town, and began driving to the chosen trail. At first the path was relatively even and beaten down, 
                        however as we rose in elevation it turned into rough chunks of rock and the mountain closed in to a narrow canyon. I quickly 
                        realized how serious this group of 60-70 year olds were about their weekly "walks". We ate lunch at the top, and made our way 
                        down a different trail totalling in 10.5 miles. Needless to say I slept like a rock that night.
