# CS463 Final Project

## About

This website is a culmination of the skills I learned in CS463. I used HTML Javascript and CSS to completely rework a website I had previously built as a blog in order to make it more accessible, responsive, and cleaner overall. I should note that instead of the projects/previous experience tab I created blog posts. One of the biggest imporovements I can highlight is dynamically loading the navbar and footer instead of copying it into every file in the navigation tree. The site is hosted in github pages, and simply having the files reference each other in the way they're structured in the filesystem allows for very easy deployment.
